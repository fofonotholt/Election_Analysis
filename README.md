# Election_Analysis
Bootcamp Module 3 Challenge, PyPoll with Python.

## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of the challenge is to help the Colorado Board of Elections to audit the results of the elections for the congessional precinct. The Board has asked us to create an automated Python report to get the number and percentage of votes for each candidate, as well as getting the results on the winner by popular vote. We will Also get the number of votes by each county and the percentage of the votes in each county, compared with the total number of votes.

## Election-Audit Results
In the following image, we can see the results for the election audit:

Analyzing the results of the given data, we can conclude the following:
- In this congressional election we can see there were 369,711 votes casted.
- As we can see in the image Jefferson County was the second largest voting county, with 38,855 votes which make up 10.5% of the total votes. Denver was the county with the most votes, casting 306,055 votes, which make up for an impressive 82.8% of the total votes. As we can observe, Arapahoe was the county with the least amount of votes, with 24,801 which accounts for 6.7% of the total votes.
- As previously mentioned, we can see Denver was by far the county with most votes casted in this election, having more than 4 times more votes than Jefferson and Arapahoe combined.
- As we can appreciate in the report, we have 3 candidates in the race. The first candidate was Charles Casper Stockham with 23% of the votes, which can be translated into 85,213 votes. We also have Diana DeGette who had 73.8% of the total votes, which is 272,892 votes. And our last candidate is Raymon Anthony Doane, who received 3.1% of the votes, he got voted for 11,606 times in this election.
- The winner for this election is Diana DeGette, she got an impressive majority, receiving 272,892 votes, that makes up for 73.8% of the total votes. A clear winner.

## Election-Audit Summary
Board Members of the Colorado Board of Elections,
An automated process is definitely, an essential part of our modern society. As humans we tend to make mistakes and get tired of doing repetitive chores. Computers on the other hand, can be asked to do the same command over and over, and will always do it with the same energy and without mistakes. An automated process for the elections process and save time and money to any organization. A Python process for elections can get fast, efficient and unexpensive results. We want to help you get the best results in the best way. You can use our Python code to automate elections, not just in county congressional elections, but also in senatorial races, general elections, and any voting process than you may need. This Script can be modified to get automated results for other elections, such as Governor elections. The script can also be used to get referendum results, to see if a proposal is popular or not. If you are interested, contact us so we can work out an arrangement.
